# Part 01: The QBasic Bondage Experience!
A DOS coding adventure with the following challenges
* Write a fancy graphics Demoscene-like effect with a maximum binary size of 256 Bytes
* Run it from BASIC and successfully return to BASIC without crashing
It consists of the following files:
* SWARM.ASM: 2 glowbugs having fun, Assembler Sourcecode
* SWARM.COM: plain DOS executable graphics effect
* SWBAS.BIN: like the DOS executable, except it returns from far
* BIN2DATA.BAS: Auxiliary tool for converting binary data to BASIC DATA statements
* RUMPF.BAS: The BASIC program without data
* HARDCORE.BAS: The final BASIC program executing the binary 
* MAKE.BAT: creates SWARM.COM, SWBAS.BIN, HARDCORE.BAS (requires TASM, TLINK and QBASIC in path, along with other obvious DOS tools)
All code commented in German language, like I did in 1999, sorry :-P

## Toolz Hall of Fame 
* Turbo Assembler 3.1 (TASM + TLINK)
* Turbo Debugger (TD)
* DOS DEBUG 
* DOS EDIT
* DOS QBASIC
